    <!-- Inline CSS styling method Example-->
    <div class="css" id="inline" style="border: solid 1px black">
      <h3>Inline Method</h3>
      <p>
        Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style,
        you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without
        using selectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be
        styled individually. Managing your website may become too hard if you
        only use inline CSS. However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some
        situations. For example, in cases where you don’t have access to CSS
        files or need to apply styles for a single element only.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="css" id="internal">
      <h3>Internal Method</h3>
      <p>
        Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add a style tag in the head
        section of your HTML document.
      </p>
      <p>
        This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However,
        using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put
        CSS rules on every page of your website.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="css" id="external" style="background-color: red;">
        <!-- In the current example, the div with the id="external" has been styled in three differetn methods namely, inline, internal and external.
As we can clearly see, the inline styling method has dominated the rest two methods and the background color has become red as defined in inline syling method.-->
      <h3>External Method</h3>
      <p>
        With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file,
        which can be created by any text editor in your device (e.g.,
        Notepad++).
      </p>
      <p>
        This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large
        website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at
        once.
