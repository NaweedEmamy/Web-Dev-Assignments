The fundamental distinction between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout lies in their design principles. Flexbox is primarily intended for one-dimensional layouts, such as either a row or a column, while Grid was created to facilitate two-dimensional layouts, enabling the simultaneous manipulation of both rows and columns.
In many cases, we might use both CSS Grid and Flexbox in combination to achieve our desired layout. They can complement each other in more complex designs.
However, we use Grid Layouting when  design requires a grid-based structure, such as a spreadsheet, card-based layout, or a magazine-style grid and we use CSS Layouting when our design requires items of varying sizes to grow or shrink to fill available space.
