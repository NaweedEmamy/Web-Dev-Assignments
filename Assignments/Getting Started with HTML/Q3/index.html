    <h1>
      Starfield maker on 'choice anxiety', long games and exclusive titles
    </h1>
    <p>
      Todd Howard, game director of Skyrim and Fallout 4, is speaking to the BBC
      ahead of the launch of his most ambitious project to date. Starfield is a
      sprawling space epic, giving players the freedom to navigate the stars in
      search of action and adventure. Howard admits candidly that this new
      release, "ended up being much larger than anything we've done. At times we
      thought, 'are we in over our heads?'" It's not surprising, given the scope
      of the game Howard and his team were aiming to create.

    <h2>But how long is too long?</h2>
    <p>
      It is a question that is often asked in gaming lobbies, Whatsapp chats or
      in pubs and coffee shops.Aren't shorter, more focused and polished
      experiences the way forward? Do all modern titles need hundreds of hours
      worth of material? Doesn't that risk the inclusion of errors - all for the
      sake of providing untold options for players to choose between - when the
      majority of players won't access all the options? Howard isn't concerned:
      <br>
      "In my career I've found two things about people who play games. Often
      they do play one title for a really long time rather than moving on to
      something new.
