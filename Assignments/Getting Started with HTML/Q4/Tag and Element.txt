Tag and Element
Tags are building blocks of HTML.
A tag is mainly represented as folows:

<h1> This is a heading </h1>

Where:
<h1> is the opening tag.
</h1> is the closign tag.
and "This is a heading tag" is content.

All these parts together are known as " Element".

Not:Elements can have attributes. Attributes define some properties to the  contents. For example, size and color.
This is a n example of an elemetn containing a tag attribute:

<p style="Color: Blue">This is a content that is modified by an attribute.</p>

Due the added attribute at the beginig tag, the contetns of the elemetn will be rendered blue in the browser.
