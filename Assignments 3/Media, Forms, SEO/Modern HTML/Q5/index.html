        <h2>A few features of HTML5 are listed below:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>Semantic Elements.</h3></li>
          <p>
            When constructing an HTML script, the term “semantic” refers to the
            meaning of the text. Semantics, to put it simply, is the use of HTML
            tags that accurately reflect the content they contain. For instance,
            using the div tag doesn’t suggest the content it will carry, however
            using the p tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph
            information. There are a lot of reasons why you should write
            Semantic tags instead of normal HTML tags, to leverage SEO,
            accessibility, and browser compatibility.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Intro of audio and video</h3></li>
          <p>
            Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows
            developers to embed a video or audio on their website. HTML5 video
            can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the
            border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions,
            transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video
            super-fast and without having to build a video player. This saves
            time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more
            affordable solution.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Vector Graphics</h3></li>
          <p>
            This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely
            impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be used to draw
            graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS.
            Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also
            supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size
            makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web.
            That’s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Geolocation API</h3></li>
          <p>
            The Geolocation API is an HTML feature that is used to access the
            geographical position of a user, however, it is not accessed unless
            the user approves of it. If you’re wondering where this feature is
            useful, these come in handy while creating apps like taxi apps, food
            order tracking apps, fitness tracking apps, and more. The location
            is achieved in a way that a user sends their longitude and latitude
            and this data is sent to the backend server, after which we access
            that data to create all these fancy applications.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Local Storage</h3></li>
          <p>
            It is a modern feature of HTML and several browsers that typically
            store data in the user’s browsers and can access them with the help
            of JavaScript APIs. This feature is useful for creating offline
            applications where data is need to be stored locally. Moreover,
            using this feature you can reduce the transactions between the
            application and the backend server, creating a fast application.
            However, there are some limitations, such as there is limited
            storage, and you can not access more storage than that.
