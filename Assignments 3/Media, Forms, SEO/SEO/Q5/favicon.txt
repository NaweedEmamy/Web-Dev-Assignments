A favicon (short for “favorite icon”) is an icon that is displayed in the browser’s address bar and tab title for a website. It is used to help users quickly identify the website and distinguish it from other tabs or bookmarks.
Favicons originate as small images (usually 16 x 16 pixels) that are added to a <link> element, which is included in the <head> of the HTML document.

Here is an sample code to illustrate favicon incorporation into html:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MPage Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
