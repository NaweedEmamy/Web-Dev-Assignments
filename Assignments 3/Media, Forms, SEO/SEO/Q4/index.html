      <li>Container Queries</li>
      <p>When creating a web page for mobile, we are usually relying on Media Queries in order to adapt the layout based on the screen size. But what if you want to apply modifications based on the size of a content block? Thatâ€™s what Container Queries are for. They allow you to modify the style of an element based on the size of the parent, unlike the Media Queries which apply the changes based on the size of the viewport.</p>
      <li>New Viewport Units</li>
      <p>When developing a web page it is important to take into account the size of the screen. One way of designing with viewport is by using the viewport height unit, vh/vw (100vh being 100% of the height of the screen).</p>
      <li>CSS Nesting</li>
<p>With CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less, we can nest a CSS style rule within another rule. It allows developers to write clean and understandable code by reducing redundancy and grouping lines. This is finally possible with native CSS with the syntax & or @nest.</p>
      <li>Individual Transform Properties</li>
      A good way to give your website some animations or transitions is to use the transform property in CSS. The problem is if you want to change just one of the transform properties later on, you must write the whole definition again for all properties.
