    <h1>Introduction to Full Stack Web Development Tech Stakcs.</h1>
    <h4>What is a Technology Stack?</h4>
    <hr />
    <h5>
      A tech stack refers to a set of tools, programming languages, and
      technologies that work together to build digital products or solutions
      such as websites, mobile, and web apps.
    </h5>

    <h5>Here are a few Tech Stacks for Front End.</h5>
    <hr />

    <dl>
      <dt>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</dt>
      <dd>
        it’s a markup language for creating and displaying electronic documents
        (web pages). They are the backbone in the organization and placement of
        content on a web page.
      </dd>
      <dt>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</dt>
      <dd>
        It is responsible for the format and layout of the web pages. It
        includes the font styles, sizes, layout, color, and other aspects of a
        web page. Developers commonly use frameworks like SASS and LESS to make
        CSS more manageable and more dynamic.
      </dd>
      <dt>JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>
        Used to make web pages interactive. It’s a programming language that
        allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages; with common
        libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue. Many
        modern applications now also use TypeScript instead of basic JavaScript.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h5>The backend stack includes these elements:</h5>
    <hr />
    <dl>
      <dt>Programming languages</dt>
      <dd>
        This creates logic for apps and websites. The code link the web to a
        database. Some examples are JavaScript, PHP, and Python.
      </dd>
      <dt>Frameworks</dt>
      <dd>
        it provides support of applications based on a single programming
        language. Laravel, Django, and Ruby on Rails are few of the popular
        frameworks. Most modern applications are built using an MVC style
        framework.
      </dd>
      <dt>Web Servers</dt>
      <dd>
        You need backend servers to manage client requests. Apache, Nginx, and
        Microsoft’s Internet Information Server (IIS) are the most common web
        servers.
      </dd>
      <dt>Databases</dt>
      <dd>
        Most applications require a SQL or NoSQL database. MongoDB, PostgreSQL,
        and MySQL are common databases.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h5>Here are a few Tech Stacks for Back End.</h5>

    <dl>
      <dt>LAMP</dt>
      <dd>
        LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web
        development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and
        performance. It is an acronym that stands for:
        <ul>
          <li>Linux (operating system)</li>
          <li>Apache (HTTP server)</li>
          <li>MySQL (relational database management)</li>
          <li>PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</li>
        </ul>
        All these stack layers are free and open source. Since this tech stack
        can run on any operating system, you can interchange or modify other
        components in the same stack. Use WAMP for Microsoft Windows or MAMP for
        MacOS.
      </dd>
      <dt>ASP.NET</dt>
      <dd>
        Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years.
        Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and
        Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the
        attention of developers all over the world.
      </dd>
      <dt>MEAN</dt>
      <dd>
        One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web
        developers. Among these benefits are the use of a single language
        (JavaScript) and the underlying technologies are open source and free.
      </dd>
      <dt>MERN</dt>
      <dd>
        Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change
        Angular.js with React. The key benefits of using MERN are the React
        integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers
        simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option
        (frontend and backend). Additionally, React is known for its flexibility
        and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.
      </dd>
      <dt>Python</dt>
      <dd>
        One of the fastest-growing languages is Python. It is easy to use and
        commonly taught to college students as a beginner development language.
        It has many modern and powerful features. Python has also become very
        popular because of its heavy usage for machine learning and data
        science. It can also be used for building web applications by using the
        popular Django web framework.
