    <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <h4>Who is a full stack web developer?</h4>
    <p>
      Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and backend; so,
      the full-stack of technology that makes up a website. They are proficient
      in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in
      server, network and hosting environments. To get to this breadth and depth
      of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years
      working in a variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed
      in both business logic and user experience, meaning they are not only
      well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy
      too.
