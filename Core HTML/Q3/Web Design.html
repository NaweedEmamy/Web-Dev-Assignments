    <h4>Importance of Web designing</h4>
    <p>
      Why is web desigining important? The Internet isn’t going anywhere. In
      fact, it’s become a portal and primary method of research, connection,
      education, and entertainment in the world. As of 2021, there were 4.66
      billion global Internet users — more than half the world’s population.
      Given the rapidly-increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise
      that web development is a rapidly expanding industry. Between now and

    <h4>Web Designer</h4>
    <p>
      A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases,
      content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors,
      font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and
      categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and
      suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed
      with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and
      functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the
      keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the
      trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user
      frustration as possible is a critical consideration.
